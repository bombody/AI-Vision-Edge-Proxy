# AI-Vision-Edge-Proxy

! [GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/bombody/AI-Vision-Edge-Proxy) 

AI-Vision-Edge-Proxy ingests multiple RTSP camera streams and provides a common interface for conducting AI operations on or near the Edge

## Why use AI-Vision-Edge-Proxy?

AI-Vision-Edge-Proxy is an easy-to-use mechanism to collate feeds from multiple cameras onto a single powerful computer

For example, a network of CCTV RTSP enabled cameras can be accessed through a simple GRPC interface, where Machine Learning algorithms can do various Computer Vision tasks. Furthermore, interesting footage can be annotated, selectively streamed and stored through a simple API for later analysis, computer vision tasks in the cloud or enriching the Machine Learning training samples
